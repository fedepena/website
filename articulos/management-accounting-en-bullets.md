* Hi, my name is Federico and I'm one of the creators of myAbakus.
* Instead of trying to make a demo of the software in 3 minutes (which is impossible) or use graphic animations to explain what you can do with it (which is very common), I'm going to quickly explain the reason why it exists and its position in the accounting software market.
* I decided to do this because I'm convinced that with just this explanation, you will be able to determine if myAbakus is aligned with what you are looking for and need for your business, without having to create an account and try the software.
* In other words, create an account and try the software only makes sense, if you agree with our point of view in the market and have the problem that our product if focused on resolving.
* Now that this is clear, let's get on with it.
